hi friends. Now by moving to get pages, I'm hoping that I can improve my whole workflow a little bit. This post is actually written on my iPhone. 
Actually it is dictated on my iPhone.
I want to see if I can use the GitHub app on my phone to post some new content to my webpage.
it should actually work because I'm using the app so I'm committing right to my repository and that should trigger the get up actions workflow to build and deploy my updated webpage.
No, where this will be probably a little bit of a challenge is when it comes to posting photos.
