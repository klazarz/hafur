Actually it is dictated on my iPhone.I want to see if I can use the GitHub app on my phone to post some new content to my webpage.it should actually work because I’m using the app so I’m committing right to my repository and that should trigger the get up actions workflow to build and deploy my updated webpage.No, where this will be probably a little bit of a challenge is when it comes to posting photos."

    "content": "When this post goes online it will be already quite old. OLD!While my current version of hafur.com still online, I am already preparing a new version.I am moving back to a Jekyll-based homepage. This time I will use GitHub Pages for the hosting. This is will take away one major headache, I had the last time I was using Jekyll: The server maintenance. That part I am happy to leave to Github going forward.I think I will also stay with the default theme (I am using Chirpy) and to stay away from modifications in order to keep things working.Chirpy is out-of-the-box a theme with a nice design and good functionality. I will have to get used to the concept of ‘categories’.I am also trying to be as mindful about photo storage. Images and photos should not be stored in Github.I will be using OCI Object Storage to store all binary files.For example, this photo is stored in OCI Object Storage:"

    "content": "A few weeks back, I sold all of my camera equipment. A Fuji X-E4, a Fuji X-M1, and all the lenses for the two cameras: the 56mm f1.2, the 23mm f2, and the 18-55mm.Why? I realized how slow the system was after picking up my old Nikon D90 at my mum’s place. Yes – there you go: I sold the latest model of the Fuji X-E series, including 3 very renowned lenses, because I was playing with a 13-year-old DSLR. The focusing speed – I am primarily using single focus – of the D90 is so much better than the Fujis’. It was a whole new experience – again. Also, using the viewfinder and a ‘real’ view through the lens was just super enjoyable. I used the Nikon D90 attached to the Nikkor 18-300mm VR and took photos of my son and me in the woods. The ergonomics of this camera, which has an actual grip and does not feel like some slippery soap like the Fuji X-E4, is something else. The shutter feels like an earthquake when released. The deer in the forest escaped in sheer terror of the shutter sound. It was an absolute pleasure to use. And the colors of the Nikon are just unique. Fuji’s out-of-cam photos are really good, and with all those recipes, you have tons to work with. But this Nikon D90 produces amazing JPGs.How could I ever use a Fuji mirrorless camera to take some photos? Everything had to go. The Fuji X-E4 was an absolute mistake. The ergonomics of the camera are a nightmare. Not a pleasure to use.The Fuji X-M1, on the other hand, was an excellent camera. It produced great photos (I even thought they looked better than the X-E4’s photos). But the focus was so slow. And trying to get some shots in focus of a two-year-old who is constantly on the run is just a matter of luck than anything else.The 23mm f2 was my favorite Fuji lens: Small, and the photos were great. And I became a big fan of the 35mm full frame equivalent. The 56mm f1.2 is a banger – but I did not use it. The few times I did use it, the photos were terrific. I have never used the kit lens despite everyone saying it is a great one.As I decided to sell the Fujis, there was no point in keeping the lenses anyway, so I sold everything. Was that a bit impulsive? Maybe…but the experience with the Nikon was too good. I need to change the camera system – at least, I was convinced.Anyways, this post should be more eulogy on the great Nikon D90, which, after 13 years, still holds string and competes with all the modern cameras of this age. The camera has seen better days: I have to fix the flash with duct tape, and the little thumb-grippy thingy on the back came loose. Nothing holds me back from picking up this long-forgotten gem again.Here are a few photos taken with my beloved Nikon D90 over the past 13 years:"
